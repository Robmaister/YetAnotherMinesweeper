This is a simple minesweeper clone I wrote in about 5 hours on a Friday night.
I wrote it because I was starting to feel less motivated while working on
several larger projects. Writing a simple program from concept to completion,
even if the idea isn't original, provides the reward of actually having
completed something. It is said that the reassurance of your ability to finish
a project motivates you to continue working on the larger projects that seem to
have no end. After writing this program, I definitely agree with the statement.
I'm not particularly proud of the actual code, as it was written hastily, but
it was good enough to get the project done in 5 hours, and that's the point.

I'm open sourcing this project and releasing it under the zlib license. I hope
it's useful to someone.
